Rules
======

.. warning:: 
    Discovering a new kind of offense not yet enumerated in these rules does not mean you are free from consequence for abusing it. Your conduct will be dealt with by a staff member, and will likely face significant consequences as a result. Similarly, if you make your quest to be as toxic to the community as possible while staying within the letter of the rules, you may still find yourself removed without appeal.

.. warning:: 
    Your Minecraft account is an extension of both your Discord and Patreon subscription. If you VIOLATE RULES in the Minecraft server you will face repercussions in both of those aspects as well.
