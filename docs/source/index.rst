Development Log #1: Jul 7th, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There hasn't been an update for a while so I'm here to showcase what we've been up to for the past couple weeks! Definitely expect an update every thursday from now on.

A lot of you have been using the feedback command on the server and in turn we fixed a number of bugs that were reported! So pls keep on using /feedback to report any bugs AND features you want added. We regularly browse the features and add them in. 

As a lot of you know, we switched server hosts from Bisect to Pufferfish where we now have our own bare metal server located in Ashburn, VA, USA. We finally finished the migration and removed all Bisect branding from the server.

The creative server was left abandoned for a LONG time and eventually shut down and never turned back on... So Ian  took to revamping and enabling the server back up! TONS of changes were added and everything was updated! To put it into perspective, its a fully new generated world which ian had to import all the plot data into. Took a lot of work and it definitely paid off!

In terms of the SMP we left it the same, just fixed a couple bugs!

Ian also went to work into players QoL and added a cross server tab-list so no matter what server you are on, you can tell if your friends are online.

Now we get to the juicy developer stuff, James has been brought on and has added a ton of infrastructure updates to prepare for our next server launch AND make our current server work efficiently and better! We switched from our old infrastructure to our new one seamlessly and you should not be able to see a difference but it allows us more freedom to add features and expand in the future.

There are also current bugs that have not been fixed but have been acknowledged.



You should definitely check out the changelog for more in-depth (jargon heavy) descriptions!
